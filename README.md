## sanity check:

Script to make some sanity-check figures of some variables to be plotted on an internal website.

## compare stats:

This is a simple Python3 command line program created by Gerasimos Michalitsianos that iterates through the corresponding variables of two NetCDF4 or GRIB files and computes some basic statistics (mean, min, max, and standard deviation), writing these statistics to a text file. For each variable, a difference matrix is ​​computed (e.g., the absolute value of the first matrix minus the second matrix), and the same statistics of these differences are computed and written to the output text file.
